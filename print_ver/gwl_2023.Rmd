Up to 1 million British Columbians are estimated to consume groundwater,
and hundreds of groundwater aquifers provide water for industries,
municipalities, farms, and rural homeowners in B.C. British Columbia operates a provincial [observation well network of over 200 wells](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B03D0994BB5C4F98B6F7D4FD8610C836), which was established in 1961 to monitor groundwater availability in areas of high human use.

-   Observation wells are not used for domestic or commercial use, but
instead provide monitoring information on groundwater levels over time.

-   Monitoring groundwater levels allows us to know how much groundwater
is available given human use patterns, aquifer characteristics,
weather and climate patterns^[1](#fn1)^. Aquifers are geological formations of permeable rock, gravel, or sand containing or conducting groundwater.

-   This indicator presents an analysis of long-term trends
in groundwater levels recorded at `r nrow(attr_wells)` observation wells that have been monitored for ten years or more and that were active as of 2009.

-  Groundwater level trends are summarized using three long-term trend categories: Stable or Increasing, Moderate Rate of Decline (3 to 10 cm/year), and Large Rate of Decline (more than 10 cm/year).


\newpage

## Provincial Summary of Trends in Groundwater Levels

-   Of the `r nrow(attr_wells)` examined observation wells, `r round(sum(state.summary[c("Stable","Increasing"),"prop"]*100))`% have water levels that are stable or increasing (with `r state.summary["Increasing","n"]` wells showing increasing trends), `r round(state.summary["Moderate Rate of Decline","prop"]*100)`% of wells show a moderate rate of decline in water levels, and `r round(state.summary["Large Rate of Decline","prop"]*100)`% show a large rate of decline in water levels. Note that only wells with enough data for trend analysis are included in the following figures.

## More About Groundwater Levels

Groundwater levels are sensitive to precipitation, aquifer storage capacity, recharge rate&mdash;the rate at which surface water trickles down to refill a groundwater aquifer&mdash;and human withdrawal. Groundwater level trends presented here indicate long-term changes in water level, but have not been corrected for changes in precipitation patterns or other factors. Thus, any significant trends are not necessarily directly attributable to human use. However, information on long-term trends can be useful for prompting further research and informing decision-making.

## Appendix: Detailed Maps & Graphs for Groundwater Observation Wells Included in the Analysis

Three plots were created for each examined groundwater observation well, including a map of the well’s location (upper left).

The graph to the right of the map shows monthly groundwater levels
relative to the annual average water level. This illustrates the seasonal nature of
water levels recorded in that well&mdash;many wells will have higher than
average water levels in the spring, and lower than average levels in the
late summer and fall. The shaded blue area shows the range of variation
within which 90% of water level observations in that month fall.

The bottom plot&mdash;called a "hydrograph"&mdash;on each page shows the monthly
groundwater levels for the history of the well, with light grey
dots show missing values which were interpolated (see Methods). The trend category is provided below the title&mdash;if the trend is significant, based on a combination of statistical and environmental significance criteria&mdash;the calculated change in annual average groundwater levels is provided (meters per year) and visually represented by an orange trend line.

Download the 'bcgroundwater' package from [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater). The source code for repeating the analysis presented on this page is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/groundwater-levels-indicator).

### Trend Analysis

Trend analysis was conducted using monthly groundwater levels from each
groundwater observation well that had ten or more years of data, fewer
than 25% of monthly observations missing, and was active as of January 1,
2008. This resulted in `r nrow(attr_wells)` wells with suitable data records for analysis. 

For each month that had more than one observation, the median was taken. After the time series were constructed, each was
inspected for consecutive missing values near the
beginning or the end of the time series, due to the strong influence of
these regions on trend analysis. If there were more than four
consecutive missing values in the first or last 10% of the time series,
the time series was truncated to remove the missing values. Remaining 
missing values were interpolated by first fitting a 12-period (i.e.,
monthly) basic structural time series model (BSM) to the data
[@harvey1990forecasting]. Fixed-interval smoothing
[@DurbinKoopman2001ts] was then applied to the fitted model to generate
predicted values for the entire time series; the predicted values were
substituted into the orignal time series where there were missing data.
This resulted in a full monthly time series for each well, with one
observation per month.  Finally, the
mean annual groundwater level was calculated for each well, and trend
analysis was performed using the annual values.

Each groundwater-level time series was analyzed for trend using
Trend-Free Pre-Whitening to remove lag-1 autocorrelation, which can
artificially increase the probability of detecting a significant trend
[@YuePilon2002autocorr]. In this method, the slope of each time series
is estimated using the Theil-Sen approach [@sen1968slope]. If the
estimated slope is different from zero, then the data are detrended by
the slope and the AR(1) 1s calculated for the detrended time series. The
residuals and the trend are combined and then tested for significance
using the Mann-Kendall trend test. These methods were implemented using
the R package ‘zyp’ [@pkg_zyp].

## Observed Long-term Trend Categories

The observed long-term trends were categorized using a combination of statistical and environmental significance criteria. Based on both the significance and magnitude of the calculated trend, trends in water levels in wells were classified as exhibiting the following categories:

-   **Stable or Increasing:** the trend was not significantly different from zero or the trend was significantly different from zero with an increasing trend or the trend was significantly different from zero with a declining trend of less than 3 cm per year.
-  **Moderate Rate of Decline:** the trend was significantly different from zero with a declining trend of between 3 and 10 cm per year.
-  **Large Rate of Decline:** the slope was significantly different from zero with a declining trend of more than 10 cm per year.

Time series were not corrected for precipitation or any other climatic
or hydrologic processes. As such, no causation for trends are implied.
