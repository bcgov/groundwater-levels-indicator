# Long-term Trends in Groundwater Levels in B.C.

This repository contains [R](http://www.r-project.org) code that calculates long-term trends in groundwater levels. It supports an indicator published on [Environmental Reporting BC](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/water/groundwater-levels.html). 

The scripts use the [bcgroundwater R package](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater/) and groundwater monitoring data from the [B.C. Observation Well Network](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/groundwater-wells-aquifers/groundwater-observation-well-network) to:

- analyze long-term trends of groundwater levels
- produce provincial-scale and individual well summary statistics
- generate supporting data visualizations

## Usage

### Data

All the data sourced for the analysis is provided under the [Open Government Licence â€“ British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).

- Groundwater level monitoring data are downloaded from the 
  [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/57c55f10-cf8e-40bb-aae0-2eff311f1685) via the [`bcgroundwater` R package](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater)
- Groundwater well attribute data are downloaded directly from the
  [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e4731a85-ffca-4112-8caf-cb0a96905778)
- Natural Resource Regions used in the summaries are sourced from the [`bcmaps` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcmaps/index.html)


### Code

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

- 01_clean.R
- 02_analysis.R
- 03_visualize.R
- 04_output.R
